# Cross-Paradigm Hex Game: Scala Backend with JavaFX and Java UI Layers
The project is a multi-paradigm programming assignment for the 2022/2023 academic year, focusing on developing an interactive, medium-scale application using different programming paradigms. The business logic is implemented in Scala using functional programming principles, while the presentation layer is developed with JavaFX, utilizing Java for both text-based (TUI) and graphical (GUI) user interfaces.

The project's main goal is to build a playable version of the board game *Hex*, with features such as random move generation, move undo functionality, and checking for game-winning conditions. The GUI provides additional options like configurable settings and color choices. 

Java and JavaFX were specifically used for the GUI portion of the project.
