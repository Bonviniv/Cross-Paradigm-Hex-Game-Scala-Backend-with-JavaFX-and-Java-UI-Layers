# Cross-Paradigm Hex Game: Scala Backend with JavaFX and Java UI Layers

An interactive, medium-scale implementation of the board game **Hex**, combining **functional programming** in **Scala** for game logic with **Java** and **JavaFX** for both textual and graphical user interfaces. Designed as a cross-paradigm programming assignment for the 2022/2023 academic year.

## üìã Project Overview
- Multi-paradigm architecture using **Scala** and **Java**
- Functional backend logic in **Scala**
- User interfaces built with **JavaFX** (GUI) and Java (TUI)
- Based on the strategic board game **Hex**

## üîç Key Features
- Fully playable **Hex** game with win detection
- Random move generation for single-player simulation
- **Undo** functionality for move rollback
- GUI with **configurable options** (e.g., colors, board size)
- Dual interface support: **Text-based (TUI)** and **Graphical (GUI)**

## üí° Additional Functionalities
- Functional core ensures immutability and clean state transitions
- Decoupled architecture between UI and game logic
- Clear separation of concerns via cross-language module design

## üß™ Development & Methodology
- Business logic developed in **Scala** using **functional programming**
- **Java** used for integration and UI layers
- GUI implemented with **JavaFX** for interactive experience
- Emphasis on modularity, reusability, and scalability
- **Git** for version control and team collaboration
